As I wonder what to do
a pebble got stuck in my shoe
as I bent to remove my socks
my shoe fell under the rock
I started chasing that shoe
then I realized I had flue
I had to stop to catch my breath 
then I heard a quack quack
I ran to see that quacking source
suddenly an ant stung my toe
then I realized I had no socks
and made me remember that shoe and rock
now it's quite dark and cold
and I'm sobbing coz I'm lost
then I remember, I'm just a lil frog
