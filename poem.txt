As I wonder what to do
a peble got stuck in my shoe
as i bent to remove my socks
my shoe fell under the rock
i started chasing that shoe
then i realized i had flue
i had to stop to catch my breath 
then i heard a quack quack
i ran to saw that quacking source
suddenly an ant stung my toe
then i realized i had no socks
and made me remember about that shoe and rock
now it's quite dark and cold
and i'm sobing coz i'm lost
then i remeber i'm just a lil frog
